# extract the csv file and dump into a database table. Note the table needs to be be created specifically for the csv file 


# given the table, the schema - and the user query, use an llm to generate the sql. make sure the sql is valid. you may need to think of cases where it produces irrelevant sql.


# implement this sql and get the output , and return as csv (reuse code from previous -format table method)
