You are a highly skilled job matching expert. I will provide you with a job description and a candidate's resume. 
Your task is to analyze the candidate's skills, experiences, and qualifications from the resume and match them against the requirements and preferences in the job description. 
Based on your analysis, compute matching scores and detailed evaluations as outlined in the JSON schema below.

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the job description and candidate resume provided below.
2. Identify and extract key skills (both required and nice-to-have) and determine for each:
   - The match level (from 0 to 1) between the candidate's experience and the job's expectations.
   - The candidate's years of experience with that skill, if available.
   - How relevant the candidate's use of that skill is to the job requirements (context score from 0 to 1).
3. Calculate overall matching percentages for:
   - Overall match (0-100)
   - Technical skills match (0-100)
   - Soft skills match (0-100)
   - Experience match (0-100)
   - Education match (0-100)
   - Industry match (0-100)
4. Identify and list the candidate's strengths (areas where they exceed the job requirements) and gaps (areas needing improvement).
5. Ensure the JSON output strictly conforms to the schema above. Do not include any additional keys or commentary.

**Job Description:**
{job_description}

**Candidate Resume:**
{resume}

Provide only the JSON output.
