You are a highly skilled job matching expert. I will provide you with a job description and a candidate's resume. 
Your task is to analyze the candidate's skills, experiences, and qualifications from the resume and match them against the requirements and preferences in the job description. 
Based on your analysis, compute matching scores and detailed evaluations as outlined in the criteria below.

**Instructions:**
- Evaluate the candidate's resume against the job description criteria.
- For each category that requires a list of scores (technical skills, soft skills, experience, education, and tools & technology), produce a list of objects. Each object must contain a `skill_description` (the name of the requirement) and a `score` (an integer from 0 to 5 reflecting how well the candidate meets that requirement).
- Make sure to include all skills in the job description. **You MUST score all skills**. 
- For `location_match`, assign a score of 5 if the candidate is in the same city, 4 if in the same state, 3 if in the same country, and 0 otherwise.
- For `industry_match`, assign a score from 0 to 5 based on the candidate's industry experience.
- Identify the candidate's strengths (areas where they exceed the job requirements) and gaps (areas that need improvement).

Please produce your output in valid JSON format that exactly matches the data model provided. Do not include any additional text or commentary.

**Job Description:**
{job_description}

**Candidate Resume:**
{resume}

Provide only the JSON output.
